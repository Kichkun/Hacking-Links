React

- Use UI Kits and existing themes, not just only components from Material, Bootstrap, etc.
- Try [Rekit](https://rekit.js.org/docs/get-started.html) - React IDE that will boost app development at hack at least 2 times.
- Use React starters/templates.
 
 [Here](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit) is very cool starter-kit for Node.js, Express, GraphQL, React.js, Babel, PostCSS, Webpack, Browsersync kit.
 
[And here](https://blog.bitsrc.io/11-react-application-boilerplates-for-2019-b49a8226ea54) is whole collection of kits, makes fit for almost every project, even production.

Angular

- ng add is your friend to use packages
- Use starters and existing apps

Node.js

- Use yeomann generator/loopback framework to generate CRUD REST API fast as fuck.

[This (TypeScript)](https://github.com/cdimascio/generator-express-no-stress-typescript) and [this](https://github.com/diegohaz/rest) is good to use and create complete API.

You should definitely check headless CMS if your idea is to create something really fast with everything in the box.
[Strapi](https://strapi.io/) and [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) are good for this. 


ML in frontend

CAUTION! There are no way back!

You can setup and run ML models in browser much faster, than Python/C++ ones, but training may take much longer.
You can use trained Python/C++ models in browser with Tensorflow.

You can use [Tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js), [Brain](https://brain.js.org/#/), [ML.js](https://github.com/mljs/ml) and existing models to use right in your browser.
Not every ML lib will work on the server side, keep this in mind.

Workflow

- Use Heroku/Now/GitGub Actions/Bitbucket Pipelines for CI and quick demo workflow
